## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the HR Hire Agent running on your local machine using Docker.

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) must be installed on your system.
*   You need API keys for **Google Gemini** and **Twilio**.
*   You need SMTP credentials for sending emails (e.g., a Gmail [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hr-hire-agent.git
cd hr-hire-agent
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

*   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory by copying the example:
    ```bash
    # (On Windows Command Prompt)
    copy .env.example .env
    # (On Linux/macOS/Git Bash)
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
*   Open the `.env` file and fill in your secret keys and credentials. **This is the most important step.**

    ```env
    # .env

    # --- IMPORTANT: Change this for Docker ---
    # Use 'db' as the hostname to connect to the Dockerized MySQL service
    DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://root:YourRootPassword@db:3306/ats"

    # --- API Keys ---
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid"
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
    TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER="whatsapp:+14155238886" # Your Twilio WhatsApp number

    # --- Email (SMTP) Settings ---
    SMTP_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
    SMTP_PORT=587
    SMTP_SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
    SMTP_USERNAME="your-email@gmail.com"
    SMTP_PASSWORD="your_16_character_gmail_app_password"
    HR_RECIPIENT_EMAIL="your-hr-team-email@example.com"
    ```

### Step 3: Build and Run with Docker Compose

*   From the root of the project directory, run the following command. This will build the frontend and backend images, pull the MySQL image, and start all three containers.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *   `--build`: Forces a rebuild of your images if you've made code changes.
    *   `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

### Step 4: Access the Application

*   Once the containers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    **`http://localhost`**

*   The application should be fully functional!

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

*   **View live logs for the backend:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f backend
    ```

*   **View live logs for the frontend (Nginx):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f frontend
    ```

*   **Force a rebuild of all images:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
